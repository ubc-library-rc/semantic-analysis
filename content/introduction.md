## What is Sentiment Analysis? 


## Common Types of Sentiment Analysis

1. **Standard sentiment analysis**\
Detects polarity of a sentiment within a text and classifies it as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.\
For example:

2. **Fine-grained Sentiment Analysis**\
Also focused on polarity, this type of sentiment analysis adds a few more categories to obtain more granular results.\
For example:

3. **Emotion detection (ED)**\
This branch of sentiment analysis detects and analyses the emotions that underlie a text. It makes associations between words and emotions like anger, happiness, frustration, etc.\
For example:

4. **Feature or Aspect-Based sentiment analysis**\
Texts are dissected to identify the features of a product that are discussed and the sentiments expressed about these features or aspects. In many cases, a binary positive/negative does not reflect differing sentiments expressed in different aspects of a single text.\
For example, a restaurant reviewer may love the food but be frustrated with the service.
