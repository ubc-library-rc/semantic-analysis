# Example in practice - NLTK with VADER

## What is VADER?
VADER, or [Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning](https://pypi.org/project/vaderSentiment/), is an open-source model used for sentiment analysis. It can detect both polarity (positive / negative) and intensity of a sentiment. It is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media, and works well on texts from other domains.
