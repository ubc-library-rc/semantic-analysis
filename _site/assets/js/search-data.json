It can be used for a wide range of research topics such as assessing public perceptions of an event, monitoring emotion on social media, and analysing customer reviews and attitudes. In this workshop we’ll look at Sentiment Analysis across disciplines, discuss strengths and limitations, and introduce common tools and procedures. Then we’ll look at an example using Python’s NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) with a model called VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning). Finally, we’ll do a hands-on activity to calculate sentiment for a paragraph of text using the programming language Python, Anaconda (an open source tool for organizing and setting up your Python environment), and NLTK.

Using Anaconda without Navigator . To get started with Python we need to create a new Anaconda environment using the “conda” command. This calls on Anaconda to make a new bucket with the correct environment variables for a given version of python. The base command is as follows where “myenv” is the name of your new environment. Input . conda create -n myenv . And if you want to specify a specific version of python you can add it after the base command. Input . conda create -n myenv python=3.6 . Once created you need to activate the environment to use it. Let’s say you’ve made several environments and want to double check or delete what you’ve done. Input . conda info --envs . Activate conda environment . Input . conda activate myenv . and check it is correctly set up. Input . conda env --list .
